====================================================================================================================================

Hey there! I'm Umar, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo. I bring over three years of experience in software development with C++, Python, and more.
* I've developed high-performance robotics autonomy software, encompassing perception, prediction, and planning. These experiences include building ML data pipelines optimized for GPU and cloud deployment, with diverse data types like imagery, video, and point clouds. My work in this area demonstrates a deep understanding of classical algorithms, CNNs, and Transformers. 
* In roles at AeroVect and Musashi AI, I took ownership of significant projects, such as a lane-detection system to improve localization and a web app for large-scale image dataset organization through embedding clustering, respectively.
* Enthusiastic about full-stack development having deployed multiple web applications, often with the Flask, React, and PostgreSQL stack.
