====================================================================================================================================

Hey there! I'm Umar, a Computer Engineering graduate from the University of Waterloo. I bring over two years of experience in software development specializing in Robotics/Autonomy, AI, and Web Apps. I enjoy innovative approaches to address real-world challenges and problem-solving by integrating hardware and software. 
* I've developed high-performance robotics autonomy software, encompassing perception, prediction, and planning. My experience includes building ML data pipelines optimized for GPU and cloud deployment, with diverse data types like imagery, video, and point clouds. My work in this area demonstrates a deep understanding of both classical algorithms and advanced neural networks, including CNNs and Transformers. 
* In roles at AeroVect and Musashi AI, I took ownership of significant projects, such as a lane-detection system to improve localization and a web app for large-scale image dataset organization through embedding clustering, respectively. These projects showcase my ability to implement complex systems, work collaboratively in team settings, and deliver solutions that meet organizational goals. 
* I have experience in full-stack development, where I've deployed multiple web applications most often using Flask, React, and PostgreSQL. This skill set underscores my versatility and ability to handle various aspects of software development.
